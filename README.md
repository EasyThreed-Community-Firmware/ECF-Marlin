# EasyThreed Community Firmware Binaries
Community maintained Marlin Firmware binaries for the EasyThreed family of 3D Printers

Please see the [Beginner's Guide](https://github.com/EasyThreed-Community-Firmware/Marlin/wiki/Beginner%E2%80%99s-Guide) for instructions.

# Goals:
- Host up to date firmware binaries for EasyThreed printers, maintaining out of box features and providing access to new ones as Marlin develops
- Merge all EasyThreed features and configurations back into upstream Marlin, so they are maintained as part of new releases
- Maintain a wiki with information about EasyThreed printers
- Please see the wiki for more information https://github.com/EasyThreed-Community-Firmware/Marlin/wiki
